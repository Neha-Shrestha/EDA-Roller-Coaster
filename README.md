# EDA of RollerCoaster Data

This repository contains code for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a roller coaster dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary objective of this project is to derive insights into various factors affecting roller coaster designs and popularity through thorough data exploration and visualization.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Utilized Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore the roller coaster dataset.
- Conducted thorough analysis to understand the characteristics and trends within the dataset.
- Visualized key factors affecting roller coaster designs and popularity through insightful plots and graphs.
